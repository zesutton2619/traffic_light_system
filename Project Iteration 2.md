# 1. Access Controls 
## I added acess controls to the repository so that only collaborators have access to the code and can make edits. 
# 2. Arduino 
## I cleared the arduino that had the traffic light assembly code on it. This way the only way use the arduino is to have the code. From now on I will also clear the code each time the arduino isn't being used.  
# 3. Physical Security
## I have the arduino I more secure location and have the components of the traffic light system disconnected so that I would be harder to actually use the system even if someone were to somehow have access to the code. 
# Online Repository
## The benefit of having the code hosted on a online repository is that it is easy to add access controls and share code to contributors. It also increases network security because of github's network security and you can see who all has acceess to a repository as well as who has edited it.
