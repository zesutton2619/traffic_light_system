1. The first issue fixed was adding backups. I fixed this by adding the project to github which allows for the project to be backed up on github while I also have a local copy of the code. Having the project backed up on github allows for better security as only certain people have access to the project. The local backup I have is only accessable by password as well. https://github.com/zesutton2619/traffic_light_system/issues/1 
2. The second issue fixed was adding accounting. By having the project on github I can see now who makes changes to the code. This allows for me to track changes made to the code but also who made the changes. I can also see what changes and when those changes were made. https://github.com/zesutton2619/traffic_light_system/issues/2

The next four items I will work on are 1. Third Pary Libraries Priority: Low, Difficulty: Not Fixable 2. Physical Security Priority: Low, Difficulty: Difficult 3. OS access controls Priority: High, Difficulty: Moderate 4. Cloud based platform Priority: Mid, Difficulty: Easy.
